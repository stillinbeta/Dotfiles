A collection of .files from my home directory. I've spent more time on these 
files than is strictly neccessary. They give some insight into how I use my 
computer, and how much tweaking I'm willing to do.

.ackrc              - Setup ack for some filetype
.gitconfig          - git settings
.gitignore_global   - mostly tex extensions and .o files
.haskellrc          - vim mode in ghci
.inputrc            - vim mode EVERYWHERE
rc.lua              - config for awesome
.vimrc              - you know
.xbindkeysrc        - volume, guest mode, media buttons, etc
.xmodmap            - caps lock is escape 
.Xresources         - urxvt setup
.xinitrc            - setup trackpoint and Awesome
.zshrc              - mostly my prompt, which shows vim's insert mode and 
                      git/virtualenv status

Use ./movedot file1 file2 file3 to move files here and symlink them back to
where they belong
